# HanyuPractice
A html, css and javascript program which provides a quick and simple way to test the user's Hanyu Chinese.

Simply upload a csv file (or a txt file in the format of a csv file), which contains the vocabulary you wish to practice with, and the program will parse the file to create an rapid-fire quiz for you to test your knowledge on.

There is a sample csv file attached to the repo. Feel free to edit the file as needed to add additional words you want to test for. Just be sure to follow the general formatting seen in the sample, or else the file might not be parsed correctly. Ensure that commas are only used in the file to delimit data, and nothing else.
